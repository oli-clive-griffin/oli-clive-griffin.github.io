              <h3>Long-term goals </h3>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> I want to start a tech startup(s).</p>
              <br>
              
              <h3>Time management</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>As I‚Äôm still working part-time, my calendar shifts too much to make a regular schedule. However, <strong>I will create each week‚Äôs schedule as the roster comes out on the preceding thursday.</strong></li>
                <li>Too much of my time is currently wasted between 9:30pm and 1am. If i can cut out as much as possible of this and get to bed early, then i will be able to wake up earlier and have more effective time. 5 days a week, I have an activity ending after 9, whether that‚Äôs BJJ or work.<strong>I will be strict in not doing any work after these and getting to bed as early as possible.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>I will take a strict 2 hour break at around 1 each day to have lunch and go to the gym.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>I will stick to the pomodoro method, doing some push ups and having a walk around every 25 minutes</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <h3>Strengths</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>I&rsquo;m very disciplined - I will work long and hard to get something done once I start it.</li>
                <li>I like people and I find it easy to get along with others</li>
                <li>I&rsquo;m very logical and good at solving problems.</li>
                <li>I&rsquo;m curious - I find the subjects of web development and computer science really fascinating.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <h3> Weaknesses (and precautions)</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>I&rsquo;m very logical - I find free-form creative exercises really hard to do if there isn&rsquo;t a clear format.&nbsp;
                  <ul>
                    <li>I will take the time to chill out and free up my mind if i ever get annoyed at any of the core work</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I&rsquo;m a perfectionist, I sometimes spend too much time perfecting small details when I should just move on
                  <ul>
                    <li>Using the pomodoro method, I will reevaluate how I&rsquo;m spreading my energy and time every 25 minutes.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I sometimes find it difficult to give up control to others in group projects
                  <ul>
                    <li>I will simply have to. I will communicate very clearly to make sure the team is always on the same page.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <h3>Strategies for help</h3>
              <p>I will not let myself waste too much time trying to figure out details that could likely be solved by my team-mates and/or facilitators, keeping in mind that asking for help benefits everyone and isn&rsquo;t selfish as it might seem.</p>
              <p>I will go to the facilitators for:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Guidance on whether I&rsquo;m doing too little or too much in activities</li>
                <li>help with major problems when coding</li>
                <li>Wisdom in how to approach and break down large problems</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
