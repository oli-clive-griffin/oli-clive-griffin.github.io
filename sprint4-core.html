          <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
          <p>Our core beliefs subtly, but very strongly influence everything we do, so when we know we can grow and
            improve, this is almost permission for our brains to do so. Understanding neuroplasticity is the key to a
            growth mindset which, in turn, is the key to improvement of any kind. We can also essentially hack the body
            into a state of neuroplasticity</p>
          <br />

          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity and how might you engage with these principles
            of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
          <br />

          <h4>Skin in the game</h4>
          <p>raising the stakes helps to increase motivation, which in turn increases neuroplasticity&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Practice</h4>
          <p>&ldquo;neurons that fire together, wire together&rdquo; repetitive practice takes advantage of
            neuroplasticity. This goes without saying, I will be practicing all the time</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Sleep</h4>
          <p>8+, preferably 9 hours of sleep a night. Connections are formed during sleep which the brain processes the
            information it gathered that day. I already try to get 8+ hours of sleep a night but this is just further
            evidence of its importance</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Reading fiction</h4>
          <p>I have been very slack with reading recently, this is even more motivation to prioritise reading
            fiction,&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Practicing an instrument</h4>
          <p>learning an instrument has profound effects on neuroplasticity. I play guitar, piano and can drum a little
            too, but i haven&rsquo;t been doing much practice at all since I left school. I will re-engage with my
            guitar and piano playing.</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Using mnemonic devices</h4>
          <p>I often do this when rote learning. For example, remembering that IDs are referenced in css with a #, I
            think of a really annoying person holding up their &ldquo;hashtag fake ID&rdquo; (weird mnemonic device but
            it works!)&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Learning information in context</h4>
          <p>helps the brain to connect information to existing information. This is very conducive to EDA because most
            of what I&rsquo;m learning is immediately put into practice, or better yet, learnt
            &lsquo;just-in-time&rsquo; because I needed to put it into practice.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Discuss Growth Mindset and why it is relevant</h3>
          <p>A growth mindset is one of the most basic and important tools for success. It is the belief that you can
            change and learn; the belief that the future you will be different from who you are today. With a growth
            mindset, challenges are surmountable, problem are solvable and inadequacies are room for improvement. A
            growth mindset is the very first precondition to success, without it you can&rsquo;t even start to
            improve.&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
          <p>One piece of an article I found very interesting was the idea that &ldquo;You Can Have Both
            Mindsets&rdquo;. I believe I have a growth mindset when It comes to academic and physical pursuits. But
            socially, I realise I&rsquo;m more fixed. Realising that I can change and, in fact, have changed,
            dramatically as a social person will help me be better able to grow.&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h3>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
          <p>I will take small steps to improve the aspects of myself that need improvement, such as organisation and
            focus. I will not be intimidated by hard tasks, Understanding that a smarter, better version of me will be
            equipped for them.</p>
