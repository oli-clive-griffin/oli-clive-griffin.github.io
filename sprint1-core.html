              <p class="c1-question">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> I honestly can't think of a serious ethical decision I've had to make recently. But rather a set of small ones. I've been working in my parents restaurant/cinema over the winter and the busiest days it gets really, really busy. Sometimes when I'd dropped the ball in some way or another - forgetting to put a customer's order through, forgetting to clean a cinema - I'd instinctively tell white lies to cover up for myself. After doing this a few times, I noticed what I was doing and was quite disappointed with myself. I'd always thought I was a radically honest person. but under stress, and when being held accountable by my workmates, I had allowed my standards to slip. since that, and especially since dwelling on this idea while doing this exercise, I've committed to being that same radically honest person I have been in the past</p>
              <br>

              <p class="c1-question">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> My family culture is very heavily focussed on taking responsibility. People who complain or seek handouts form others are not looked upon kindly in my family. My Mum has always told me that it's my responsibility to fix my own problems. As a kid, I found  that confusing as I thought that most of my problems were other people's fault. But, growing up, I began to understand what she'd meant. Even if the problems weren't my fault, no one else was going to fix them for me. They may not have been my fault (however, many times, they were) but they were always my responsibility and blaming others was not going to change that in the slightest.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> Growing up with very encouraging, self employed parents, I always had a high expectation for what life could be for me. In my family culture, success was always praised and never demonized as it often is in pop-culture. A 'normal' job with an average salary was never even a consideration for me. while others in my year group may have changed their dream job from astronaut to something more realistic, my goals haven't shrunk.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> Kindness was also a hugely important value in my upbringing. My Mum always expected me to be the kid who included the uncool kids. She made a big deal of the seniors who took me under their wing and the kids who included me in games so that I could learn how special that can be. She constantly reminded me that my granddad 'never made a joke at someone else's expense' and although that may be a bit of a strict rule to follow (who doesn't like a bit of teasing with friends) the point still stands.</p>
              <br>

              <p class="c1-question">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> I think my ambition is going to be very helpful for me in my career (duh). I believe a lot of people are capable of a lot more than they let on and if they were to let themselves want more, a lot might actually get it.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph"> I've also become far more disciplined this year. after leaving school, it's like a switch was flicked and stuff actually matters now. as if i've finally landed in the real world. However, I still have a way to go. I was lazy in school so although I've improved a lot, I‚Äôve got a way to go.</p>
              <br>

              <p class="c1-question">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">The discipline I‚Äôve developed this year will undoubtedly help me. This discipline will allow me to push myself to continue when I‚Äôm struggling. Quite self explanatory.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">I‚Äôm very competitive. This has always helped me academically and I have no doubt it will at EDA. However, I will also need to keep this in check, making sure I‚Äôm focussing on doing what‚Äôs best for my own learning, instead of what looks best or gets me ahead the most.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">I think my wide range of miscellaneous computer skills will help a lot. Born in 2001 and growing up as somewhat of a computer geek, I was practically raised on the internet and computers, so I know lots of tips and tricks that I believe will all add together to make me far more efficient.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">I have a clear drive. I think when I was lazy in school, it was almost always because the work seemed pointless. With EDA, I chose to go here for a very specific reason, and have clear goals in mind that necessitate the learning we are doing. Where, at school, I procrastinated and lacked focus, it will be (and in fact, already has been) different at EDA because of this drive and clarity.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">I‚Äôm very logical and good at problem solving. This has been, and will be helpful for the technical side of EDA, however I need to try and somewhat deactivate this side of me when doing the core work, as I tend to over-analyze questions and think in hyper-black-and-white terms.</p>
              <br>

              <p class="c1-question">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">When making coffee, the coffee needs to be taken to the table as soon as possible after it‚Äôs created, because coffee quickly degrades when left sitting there for too long. I‚Äôve found it very difficult and frustrating to get waiters to take my coffees as quickly as I would like. I tried asking the waiters/waitresses to take them every time but this always felt wrong as I was this 18 year old boy ordering around people far older than me. This in turn created frustration within myself that there wasn‚Äôt an easier way. Eventually, my manager told me to simply say ‚Äúdrinks up‚Äù loudly and clearly. I felt self-conscious doing this at first, but as I‚Äôve done it more and more, it‚Äôs become more natural and at the end of the day, it‚Äôs what needs to happen as the most important thing is the customer getting their coffee on time.</p>
              <p class="body-paragraph">Going through this process again, I would discuss the problem more openly with the waiters and waitresses, coming to the decision together that coffees should be the number 1 priority. It turns out that this would have solved a lot of the problem, as there had been a misunderstanding within the staff about the proper order of priorities. After this was sorted out with the manager, things began to run far more smoothly.</p>
