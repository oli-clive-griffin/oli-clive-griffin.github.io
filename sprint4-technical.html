          <h2>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h2>

          <p>A problem that was too common for me as I was doing the kata was simple syntax errors. These were errors that should have been able to be fixed with a simple look at the documentation but instead, took ages to find.</p>

          <p>I often used console logging to isolate the problem, for example, by logging the results of functions to see if they had worked as expected. However, once I had the problem isolated, which was fairly quick, I spent too long just blindly trying solutions without checking to see whether the most basic aspect of the code - the syntax -&nbsp; was correct. Had I checked the documentation immediately after isolating the dysfunctional code, I might have saved an hour or so of blind and incredibly frustrating experimentation.</p>

          <p>I will remember to make absolutely sure that my syntax is correct before trying other, more complex types of problem solving, because syntax errors are - at least for me - the most common, and most easily fixed problems i encounter while coding.&nbsp;</p>

          <br />
          <br />
          
          <h2>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>

          <p>When solving the &lsquo;where are you&rsquo; kata, I decided to use the array.find method. I wasn&rsquo;t super familiar with the method syntax so after having a look at some examples in the documentation (I love examples) I copied and pasted an example into my code, replacing their variables with mine and paying attention to how this translated between the two contexts.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This was a very fast and satisfying way of gaining a just-in-time understanding of the syntax. I think it&rsquo;s important to realise that for most programming problems, especially the most fundamental ones like the basic syntax of a method, there&rsquo;s almost always information readily available through google. Instead of trying to know everything, we should accept that we are practically cyborgs, with a large part of our &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; stored online and ready at hand at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I will continue to shamelessly consult google with my programming problems, embracing the concept of just-in-time learning.&nbsp;</p>

          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>

          <h3>Pseudocode</h3>

          <p>I don&rsquo;t do enough pseudocode. I tend to rush into problems without first creating a solid plan. That&rsquo;s worked fine in the easier problems, but won&rsquo;t work so well for more complex ones in the future.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Trying something</h3>

          <p>I do this a lot, probably too much</p>

          <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>

          <p>I explain things to myself often but I think it would make a difference if I did it more out loud, in a clear, logical, first principles based fashion, instead of my usual quiet muttering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
          
          <p>I pay close attention to error messages. They&rsquo;re really helpful.</p>
          
          <h3>Console.logging</h3>
          
          <p>This is one of my main tools. I use console logging to get an look into how the code is running step by step. I will console log the results of functions or the values of variables etc. at different points throughout the code to make sure it&rsquo;s working as planned.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <h3>Googling</h3>
          
          <p>I do a lot of googling, it&rsquo;s invaluable.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
          
          <p>I try to rely more on myself and google but after a long enough struggle, i will sometimes ask my peers. I think it&rsquo;s because I view this strategy as too slow, and perhaps it&rsquo;s a bit of an ego thing.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
          
          <p>I do this if i really need to</p>
          
          <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
          
          <p>I find reflection very useful, this post in particular has been very helpful in gaining insight into my own problem solving process</p>
