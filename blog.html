          <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
          <p>Our core beliefs subtly, but very strongly influence everything we do, so when we know we can grow and
            improve, this is almost permission for our brains to do so. Understanding neuroplasticity is the key to a
            growth mindset which, in turn, is the key to improvement of any kind. We can also essentially hack the body
            into a state of neuroplasticity</p>
          <br />

          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity and how might you engage with these principles
            of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
          <br />

          <h4>Skin in the game</h4>
          <p>raising the stakes helps to increase motivation, which in turn increases neuroplasticity&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Practice</h4>
          <p>&ldquo;neurons that fire together, wire together&rdquo; repetitive practice takes advantage of
            neuroplasticity. This goes without saying, I will be practicing all the time</p>

          <h3>HTML vs. CSS</h3>

          <p>A website&rsquo;s main purpose is to display information. But if the information isn&rsquo;t displayed in a
            nice way, no-one is ever going to pay attention. Websites ideally are full of useful information, displayed
            in an aesthetically pleasing way that is intuitive, easy to read, and easy to navigate around.</p>

          <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, understand and channel your emotions and those of the
            people around you. It is the way we navigate through our human world, interacting with others, and
            understanding ourselves.

              this and get to bed early, then i will be able to wake up earlier and have more effective time. 5 days a
              week, I have an activity ending after 9, whether that‚Äôs BJJ or work.<strong>I will be strict in not doing

          <p class="c1-question">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you
            weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action
            you took.</p>
          <p class="body-paragraph"> I honestly can't think of a serious ethical decision I've had to make recently. But
            rather a set of small ones. I've been working in my parents restaurant/cinema over the winter and the
            busiest days it gets really, really busy. Sometimes when I'd dropped the ball in some way or another -
            forgetting to put a customer's order through, forgetting to clean a cinema - I'd instinctively tell white
            lies to cover up for myself. After doing this a few times, I noticed what I was doing and was quite
            disappointed with myself. I'd always thought I was a radically honest person. but under stress, and when
            being held accountable by my workmates, I had allowed my standards to slip. since that, and especially since
            dwelling on this idea while doing this exercise, I've committed to being that same radically honest person I
            have been in the past</p>
