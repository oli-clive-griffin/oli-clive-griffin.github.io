          <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
          
          <ol>
            <li>I haven't been being as honest as I would like recently</li>
            <li>I find it hard to take breaks when I'm on a roll</li>
            <li>I often try to solve a problem with brute force when a more methodical approach would work better</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>What are the roles of empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            A lot of the time it's easy to get into an intellectual rut while programming and get lost in your own head. Self-awareness allows you to mediate your attention and approach a problem in an effective and efficient way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy allows us to connect with our fellow developers and work together productively. The productivity of two people working together is often greater than the sum of its parts.
          </p>

          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            Honestly, I thought it would be mostly useless and a waste of time. Although I still haven't loved it, there were some moments where I could see the value in what I was doing. For example, the values and identity activity caused a surprising amount of introspection.

          <h2>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h2>

          <p>A problem that was too common for me as I was doing the kata was simple syntax errors. These were errors that should have been able to be fixed with a simple look at the documentation but instead, took ages to find.</p>

          <p>I often used console logging to isolate the problem, for example, by logging the results of functions to see if they had worked as expected. However, once I had the problem isolated, which was fairly quick, I spent too long just blindly trying solutions without checking to see whether the most basic aspect of the code - the syntax -&nbsp; was correct. Had I checked the documentation immediately after isolating the dysfunctional code, I might have saved an hour or so of blind and incredibly frustrating experimentation.</p>

          <p>I will remember to make absolutely sure that my syntax is correct before trying other, more complex types of problem solving, because syntax errors are - at least for me - the most common, and most easily fixed problems i encounter while coding.&nbsp;</p>

          <br />
          <br />

          <h2>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>

          <p>When solving the &lsquo;where are you&rsquo; kata, I decided to use the array.find method. I wasn&rsquo;t super familiar with the method syntax so after having a look at some examples in the documentation (I love examples) I copied and pasted an example into my code, replacing their variables with mine and paying attention to how this translated between the two contexts.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This was a very fast and satisfying way of gaining a just-in-time understanding of the syntax. I think it&rsquo;s important to realise that for most programming problems, especially the most fundamental ones like the basic syntax of a method, there&rsquo;s almost always information readily available through google. Instead of trying to know everything, we should accept that we are practically cyborgs, with a large part of our &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; stored online and ready at hand at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I will continue to shamelessly consult google with my programming problems, embracing the concept of just-in-time learning.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
          <p>Our core beliefs subtly, but very strongly influence everything we do, so when we know we can grow and
            improve, this is almost permission for our brains to do so. Understanding neuroplasticity is the key to a
            growth mindset which, in turn, is the key to improvement of any kind. We can also essentially hack the body
            into a state of neuroplasticity</p>
          <br />

          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity and how might you engage with these principles
            of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
          <br />

          <h4>Skin in the game</h4>
          <p>raising the stakes helps to increase motivation, which in turn increases neuroplasticity&nbsp;</p>
          <br />

          <h4>Practice</h4>
          <p>&ldquo;neurons that fire together, wire together&rdquo; repetitive practice takes advantage of
            neuroplasticity. This goes without saying, I will be practicing all the time</p>

          <h3>HTML vs. CSS</h3>

          <p>A website&rsquo;s main purpose is to display information. But if the information isn&rsquo;t displayed in a
            nice way, no-one is ever going to pay attention. Websites ideally are full of useful information, displayed
            in an aesthetically pleasing way that is intuitive, easy to read, and easy to navigate around.</p>

          <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, understand and channel your emotions and those of the
            people around you. It is the way we navigate through our human world, interacting with others, and
            understanding ourselves.

          <p class="body-paragraph"> I honestly can't think of a serious ethical decision I've had to make recently. But
            rather a set of small ones. I've been working in my parents restaurant/cinema over the winter and the
            busiest days it gets really, really busy. Sometimes when I'd dropped the ball in some way or another -
            forgetting to put a customer's order through, forgetting to clean a cinema - I'd instinctively tell white
            lies to cover up for myself. After doing this a few times, I noticed what I was doing and was quite
            disappointed with myself. I'd always thought I was a radically honest person. but under stress, and when
            being held accountable by my workmates, I had allowed my standards to slip. since that, and especially since
            dwelling on this idea while doing this exercise, I've committed to being that same radically honest person I
            have been in the past</p>
