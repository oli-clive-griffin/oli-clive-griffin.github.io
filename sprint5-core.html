          <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
          
          <ol>
            <li>I haven't been being as honest as I would like recently</li>
            <li>I find it hard to take breaks when I'm on a roll</li>
            <li>I often try to solve a problem with brute force when a more methodical approach would work better</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>What are the roles of empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>
            A lot of the time it's easy to get into an intellectual rut while programming and get lost in your own head. Self-awareness allows you to mediate your attention and approach a problem in an effective and efficient way.
          </p>
          </br>
          <p>
            Empathy allows us to connect with our fellow developers and work together productively. The productivity of two people working together is often greater than the sum of its parts.
          </p>
          </br>

          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            Honestly, I thought it would be mostly useless and a waste of time. Although I still haven't loved it, there were some moments where I could see the value in what I was doing. For example, the values and identity activity caused a surprising amount of introspection.
          </p>
          </br>

          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            I found the lack of a clear structure to be very annoying. I like clear, logical instructions and lots of the core material was not like this at all.
          </p>
          </br>

          <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>
            Because the kind of person who takes a programming course - like me - is typically a highly logical, unemotional person and it's important to develop both aspects of the personality.
          </p>
          </br>

          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer</h3>
          <p>
            Personally I think i would've benefitted from focussing more on coding. I believe some of the core work was superfluous. Where I could see clear progress in my coding skills as I progressed through the tech work, I often couldn‚Äôt quite understand the point of the core work or how it would translate helpfully into real-life. I did, however, find the productivity-focussed parts of the core work quite interesting as they were directly relevant to the work I was doing.

            While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
