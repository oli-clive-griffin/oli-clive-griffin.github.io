              <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
              
              <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise, understand and channel your emotions and those of the people around you. It is the way we navigate through our human world, interacting with others, and understanding ourselves.</p>

              <p>The 5 element model for EQ was proposed by Daniel Goleman:</p>
              
              <h5>Self-Awareness;</h5>
              <p>The ability to recognize and understand your own emotions&rdquo; (Cherry, 2018b). Self awareness is incredibly important as it is the building block on which we build the other aspects of EQ</p>
              
              <h5>Self-Regulation;</h5>
              <p>This is one step further, self-regulation is the ability to manage and express our own emotions</p>
              
              <h5>Motivation;</h5>
              <p>People with high EQs tend to be driven more be intrinsic reasoning than by outside validation</p>
              
              <h5>Empathy;</h5>
              <p>The ability to understand what others are feeling and why. Not to validate these emotions but simply to be aware of how they feel and why.</p>
              
              <h5>Social Skills.</h5>
              <p>The ability to interact with others effectively to achieve your goals.</p>

              <br />
              <br />

              <p>How is it different to IQ?</p>
              <p>IQ is the measure of intelligence associated more with logic, reasoning and abstraction. IQ is useful for solving problems but EQ is important on a broader level. EQ handles day to day interactions both with others and with ourselves. While it is important to be able to solve a problem with brute intelligence, it is also incredibly important to be able to handle the more human problems in life. problems such as knowing when you&rsquo;re burning out, knowing why something is frustrating you, understanding why you&rsquo;re not working well with colleagues, knowing how to cheer yourself up, knowing how to get others to buy into an idea. All of these problems are within the domain of emotional intelligence.</p>
              
              <p>While you can use your IQ to solve academic problems, there are far more aspects to life that require navigation. Without EQ we are stranded and unable to use our IQ usefully, let alone function well in society.&nbsp;</p>
